O Belgium, dear mother,
To you our hearts, to you our arms,
To you our blood, o fatherland!
We all vow: you will live!
You will always live in grandeur and beauty.
And the immortal motto
Of your invincible unity will be:
For King, Right and Liberty!
Of your invincible unity will be:
For King, Right and Liberty!
For King, Right and Liberty!
For King, Right and Liberty!
