1. Stand ye Guamanians for your country
And sing her praise from shore to shore.
For her honor, for her glory
Exalt our island forever more.
For her honor, for her glory
Exalt our island forever more.

2. May everlasting peace reign o’er us,
May heaven’s blessing to us come.
Against all perils, do not forsake us,
God protect our Isle of Guam.
Against all perils, do not forsake us,
God protect our Isle of Guam.
