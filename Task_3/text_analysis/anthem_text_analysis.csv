fk,"1. In my heart there’s a call for the isles far away
Where the wind from the Horn often wanders at play.
Where the kelp moves and swells to the wind and the tide
And penguins troop down from the lonely hillside.

CHORUS:
Those isles of the sea are calling to me
The smell of the camp fire a dear memory.
Though far I may roam, some day I’ll come home
To the islands, the Falklands, the isles of the sea.

2. There’s a camp house down yonder I’m longing to see,
Though it’s no gilded palace it’s there I would be.
Just to be there again I would race o’er the foam,
For that lone house so far is my own home sweet home.

Chorus

3. Now we’re off to the Falklands, so wild and so free,
Where there’s tussock and kelp and the red diddle-dee,
And the wild rugged beauty that thrills more than me
Is bred in the bones on the isles of the sea.

Has already lost its plumes.
The blood of Italy

It drank, along with the Cossack,
But it burned its heart.

Let us sing with strong feeling
And let us show to the world
Our invincible, glorious banner.

Hail, O people who, strong and intrepid,
Launched into war and went to death!
Under a warlike menace of death,
You broke your chains of slavery.

2. No country deserves to be free
If it is an indolent and servile slave,
If the call does not grow loud within it,
Tempered by a virile heroism.

But the brave and indomitable Quisqueya
Will always hold its head high,
For if it were a thousand times enslaved,
It would a thousand times regain liberty.

3. If it will be exposed to ruse and deceit
Unto contempt of a real imposer,
On to Las Carreras! Beler! …it were places
Where the traces of glory are found.

Where on the top of the heroic bastion,
The word of the libarated became flesh,
Where the genius of Sánchez and Duarte
Taught to be free or to die.

4. And if an unattended leader the splendor
Of these glorious events could ignore,
One has seen in Capotillo in the war
The flag of fire wave.

And the fire that lets the proud lion
Of Castilla become stupefied,
Removes him from the glorious beaches
Where the crossed banner waves.

5. Compatriots, let us proudly
Show our face, from today prouder than ever;
Quisqueya may be destroyed
But a slave again, never!

It is a sanctuary of love that every character
Of the fatherland feels alive!
And it is his coat of arms, the right;
And it is his device: be free or die.

6. Liberty that still rises cool-bloodedly
The victory in her triumphal car.
And the clarion of war re-echoes
Proclaiming his immortal glory.
